Clinical Genetics Gene Lists

Daniel Nilsson

Please update only lists in the src subdirectory.

Input:

* Lists of gene symbols, one per line in text files with a .txt ending in the src directory.

Be careful to tag versions, and commit changes to genelists!

After updates, to check the lists for redundancy and concurrency of gene symbols, please run from the main directory:

./update.sh
